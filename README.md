## Project Goal and Objectives :

**Motivation :**

In many of the Manufacturing industries, a product is manufactured either by man power or by machinery or both sometimes. Once I had an opportunity to visit manufacturing unit in my country, Where the major part of the work is done by the equipmentâ€™s. There was a situation where any fault in the equipment, the maintenance is done manually. For Instance, if there was any failure in the equipment, the supervisor informs the maintenance team via phone/email. Then the maintenance team has a checklist which has steps for defect resolutions, which is time consuming process and un-trackable. This has triggered me the idea, which automates the whole process of maintenance system, which is called Factory Maintenance System(FMS).

**Significance :**

Importance of Factory Maintenance System:

1.	Notify the defects or flaws in the machinery to the particular maintenance team , through a centralized ticketing system. Which         reduces time consumption and man power.
2.	Investigate the Root cause analysis of the failure and can derive solutions to avoid such failures in future.
3.	Easy to guide the maintenance team.


**Objectives**

To create a centralized maintains  system, which automates the maintenance process in a manufacturing unit and track their root cause.
